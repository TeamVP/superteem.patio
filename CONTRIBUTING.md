# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to this starter project. Please follow these guidelines:

- Fork the repo and open a PR against `main`.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Run `pnpm install` then `pnpm test` before opening a PR.
- Use the existing coding style (Prettier + ESLint).

For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss the design.
