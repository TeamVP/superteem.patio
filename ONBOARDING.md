# Onboarding â€” Fork & Start

1. Install Node 18 LTS (or as specified in `.nvmrc`).
2. Install `pnpm` globally: `npm install -g pnpm`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set any project-specific keys.
4. Run `pnpm install` and then `pnpm dev`.
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to confirm the starter page loads.

This repository is intended to be forked and used as the base for your new app. Remove starter docs and example files as you begin to implement your application-specific specs.
