- Include CI tasks for validate, test, and e2e flows. [file:5]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Stories render without a11y violations for core states, unit tests cover rules, and E2E covers Yes/No SIBR paths and failure states. [file:7]

Deliverables:
- .storybook stories, Vitest suites, and Playwright specs referencing example templates. [file:5]
